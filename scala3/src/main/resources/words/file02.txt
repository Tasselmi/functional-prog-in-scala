If you have not guessed already – the topic of the book is “How to Forgive”. But it is not a religious book (though if you are religious it won’t offend you either). The book will show you a quick and easy way that you can use to learn how to forgive. It will also explain to you why learning to forgive is such a powerful and life changing thing to do. Everything gets radically better when you learn to forgive.
