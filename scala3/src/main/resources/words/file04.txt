The choices you make and the things that you believe are possible will all be influenced by the
ways you have not forgiven. As you learn to forgive, the energy which was going into unhappy
thoughts and feelings gets liberated and can flow into creating the life you want, rather than limiting
you or creating more suffering.
If you do not want to learn to forgive to benefit yourself; then learn to forgive so you can benefit
others. As you learn to forgive, you benefit everyone you are in contact with. Your thinking will be
clearer and more positive than before. You will have a lot more to give, and you will more readily
enjoy sharing what you have. You will naturally and easily become kinder, more generous and more
caring of others, without having to struggle to achieve this. You will have a happier and more
positive attitude to the people in your life, and they will respond more positively to you in return.
Is a forgiving person more pleasant to spend time with than an unforgiving one? Yes, of course
they are. A forgiving person is always much more pleasant to be around than an unforgiving one.
The quality of your life depends on the quality of your relationships. Every aspect of your life will
change for the better as you learn to forgive; whether in your family, your work life, or your social
life. Learning to forgive will improve all your relationships, because your attitude will improve. As
your relationships improve, then all aspects of your life will also improve
