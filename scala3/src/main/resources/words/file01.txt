You may have an aversion to the topic of the book, because it might initially seem ‘religious’ – which it is not. The principles in this book were around long before there was anything recognizable as a religion – in the modern sense – and will still be around eons from now. Also the topic might be off-putting to you because it is something you feel you should already be doing, but don’t know how. You might initially feel a twang of guilt or shame in response to the title of the book – which is why I have held back mentioning it – but there is not need for this at all. This book will set you free from guilt and shame.
