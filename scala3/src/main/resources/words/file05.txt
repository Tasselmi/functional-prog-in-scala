If you want to move up to the next level of financial abundance and success, Forgiveness will
help you achieve it. For example, if you want more money in your life, you need to make sure that
you do not resent people who have more money than you. People with more money than you are the
ones best placed to help you have more money too. If, as some people do, you resent "people with
money," then they will not be able to help you because you are not open to them while you are busy
resenting them. Likewise, if you have a positive attitude to people who are more successful than
you (you smile at them rather than scowl at them), they will see you as approachable and will more
likely want to work with you, or socialize with you
